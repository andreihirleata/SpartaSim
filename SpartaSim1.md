# Sparta Trainees Simulator

## Submission

This project will be submitted to your trainer, by email or Microsoft Teams chat message, as a GitHub link on Monday at 09:00. If you want to make the repository private on GitHub, invite your trainer to collaborate on the project and also send them an email explaining which GitHub user name is yours. In addition, a brief (10 mins max) presentation on the outcome of the project will be made on Friday at 16:00 (subject to no other academy presentations being scheduled to conflict with this).

## Overview

You have been asked to build a simulator which will help track the number of people currently training.

## Stage 1 requirements:

- The tracker needs to be able to track time in a consistent way.
- The program starts by asking how long the simulation will run for (for example, how many months).
- Every month, a random number of trainees are generated, wanting to be trained (50 - 100).
- Every 2 months, Sparta Global opens training centres; they open instantly and can take trainees every month.
- A centre can train a max of 100 trainees and takes a random number of trainees every month (0 - 50 trainees up to their capacity).
- If a centre is full, trainees can be moved to any other centre which is not full.
- If all centres are full, the trainees go onto a waiting list; this list must be served first before new trainees are taken.
- At the end of the simulation, output should show:
	- number of open centres
	- number of full centres
	- number of trainees currently training
	- number of trainees on the waiting list

## Stage 2 and 3 requirements:

These will be provided later in the week.
